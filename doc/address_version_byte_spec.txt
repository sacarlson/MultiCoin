Hello everyone,

after a discussion on IRC, we decided to try to standardize the version bytes
used by bitcoin for several applications.

There are 3 components that seem meaningful:
* network? (realnet, testnet, alternate chains?)
* data class? (address, private key, master key, ...?)
* version? (real version, per data class defined)

There is no technical reason why different network and different data classes
would need separate version bytes, but i think it is a good thing to keep
them from colliding. People will mix them up, and when things are well
defined, a nice warning message could help a lot ("Oops it seems you entered
a private key instead of an address!").

So, first of all, there is already one actually used alternate chain, namely
namecoin, using version byte 52 for addresses. For this reason, i'd like to
reserve bit 16 in the version byte for "alternate chain". When bit 16 is set,
everything is up to the network itself, and no further semantics are defined.

When bit 16 isn't set:

Then remains the rest of the network. The problem is that testnet already uses
version 111, which is not a single bit. We can use a trick though, namely
choosing bit 1 for testnet, and if bit 1 is set, XOR the rest of the version
number with 111. Otherwise, we could reset testnet (not actually reset, just
change its addresses a bit), and simply state odd=testnet, even=realnet.

That leaves use with 6 more bits to play with, namely 128,64,32 and 8,4,2.
As 128 is already used for private keys, let's use (128,64,32) for data classes,
and (8,4,2) for versions.

So, in full:
* Bits 128/64/32 define data class
** 0 = address
** 32,64,96,160,192 = reserved for future use
** 128 = private key
** 224 = extended data class, another "data class" byte follows
* Bit 16 defines "private"
** 0 = bitcoin
** 16 = alternate chain
* Bits 8/4/2 define version number
** 0 = only thing used for now
** 2,4,6,8,10,12 = reserved for future use
** 14 = extended version, another version byte follows
* Bit 1 defines testnet
** 0 = realnet
** 1 = testnet (possibly using XOR 111, if not reset)

This whole discussion started when Stefan wanted to define a format for master keys from which
to derive deterministic wallet keys, i suggest using data class 192 for that, leaving the
lower numbers for more basic data, like public keys.

Any comments?

I realize my mail may have been a bit unclear. This is about the version bytes
used in addresses and other base58-encoded data structures. I'd like to see some
convention adopted before everyone starts defining their own.

The proposal in the previous mail could be summarized by the following functions
(for non-alternate chains). It is compatible with all currently-used version bytes
that i know of (testnet, realnet, addresses, private keys, namecoin, multicoin):

enum dataclass_t 
{
    address = 0,
    privkey = 4,
    masterkey = 6,
    extended = 7
}

int EncodeVersionByte(dataclass_t class, int nVersion, bool fTestNet)
{
    return (class << 5 + nVersion << 1) ^ fTestNet*111;
}

void DecodeVersionByte(int nByte, dataclass_t& class, int& nVersion, bool& fTestNet)
{
    fTestNet = false;
    if (nByte & 1)
    {
        fTestNet = true;
        nByte ^= 111;
    }
    class = (nByte & 224) >> 5;
    nVersion = (nByte & 14) >> 1;
}

added by sacarlson:
as far as creating and testing alternate block chain to simplify just make sure your address is grater than 16 
and not to include at present:
111 = testnet
224 = extended class

at present these addresses are known to  have been used on other projects and fall into the private class:
243 = weeds
244 = groupcoin
245 = groupcoinTEST

(06:28:29 PM) sacarlson: I plan to follow and have added a copy to my release of Multicoin for this new address version spec http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=20110707111557.GA5231%40ulyssis.org&forum_name=bitcoin-development
(06:28:33 PM) minus: well as long as there's people having fun with trojan FTPs it's fine i guess
(06:30:02 PM) sacarlson: if I understand the spec as far as I need for alternate blocks would be to make sure that my address are over equal or grater than 16 and not 111, is this correct?
(06:31:14 PM) sacarlson: a no responce will be considered a yes
(06:35:44 PM) sipa: sacarlson: according to my proposal, you're free to choose anything that has bit 16 set
(06:36:02 PM) sacarlson: sipa: cool will do 
(06:36:12 PM) sipa: so there are 128 numbers to choose from
(06:36:16 PM) sacarlson: sipa: sound like a good idea to me
(06:36:30 PM) sacarlson: sipa: plus the extended
(06:37:09 PM) sipa: ?
(06:37:45 PM) sacarlson: sipa: ** 224 = extended data class, another "data class" byte follows
(06:38:17 PM) sipa: sacarlson: yes, if you're talking about data that is useful in the main bitcoin chain, but is not an address or key
(06:38:23 PM) sacarlson: so if the code for 224 then another byte is added to provide 64k
(06:38:51 PM) sipa: less, actually, since the first is always 224
(06:39:38 PM) sacarlson: sipa: well then I will random pick one of the alternate address as an extended code to provide for expansion
(06:40:05 PM) sipa: sure, you can define extensions within the private range as well
(06:41:17 PM) sacarlson: sipa: oh you defin private if bit 5 is set?
(06:41:28 PM) sacarlson: sipa: as you call it 16
(06:42:16 PM) sacarlson: opps brain fart  ** 128 = private key
(06:43:15 PM) sacarlson: so binary 10000000
(06:43:16 PM) sipa: valid "private" version numbers would be: 16-31, 48-63, 144-159, 176-191, ...
(06:43:33 PM) sipa: (nVersion & 0x10) should be nonzero
(06:44:31 PM) sacarlson: ok so my present selected 243 is a 11110011 that falls into the private class
(06:45:08 PM) sipa: indeed
(06:46:09 PM) sacarlson: sipa: I guess that I'm safe to play there then for now and figure out an extended spec at some later time
(06:46:34 PM) sipa: sure
(06:46:55 PM) sacarlson: sipa: ok thank you sir
(06:47:18 PM) sipa: don't call me that
(06:47:20 PM) sipa: :)
(06:58:00 PM) sacarlson: sipa: oh I think I have a better understanding of ** 224 = extended data class so with this we are still only define at most 510 address
(06:58:57 PM) sipa: depends, but the 'extended' thing is not really well specified now
(06:59:10 PM) sacarlson: sipa: ok
(06:59:26 PM) sipa: you could say that when both data class is 224, and version is 14, you get 2 extra bytes
(07:00:05 PM) sacarlson: sipa: ya extended extended
(07:03:22 PM) sacarlson: sipa: and to make it almost  infinite 224 and version is 15 your next is byte could be number of extra bytes to add 
(07:03:53 PM) sipa: haha, possibly
(07:04:32 PM) sacarlson: ok I'll stick that in my docs page of multicoin to make sure people don't think there will be a finite number
